First Accord is an open-source initiative specifically crafted to guide beginners into the world of GitHub contributions. It provides a friendly, structured approach for those new to open source, aiming to demystify the process and make it less intimidating. The project emphasizes simplicity and accessibility, making it an excellent starting point for anyone looking to make their very first GitHub contribution. Whether you're learning the basics of version control, branching, or collaboration on repositories, First Accord offers a step-by-step process designed to build both your skills and confidence quickly.

Beyond the technical aspects, First Accord also fosters a welcoming community, encouraging collaboration and learning through teamwork. It's not just a project but a supportive environment to help beginners take their initial steps into open source with ease.

## Objectives
at the end of this guide, I/we expect you to at least:
 * Contribute to an open-source project by utilizing the tools available on your devices.
 * Become more proficient in utilizing GitHub.

## Who is this for?
 * This is intended for individuals with no prior experience. If you are familiar with creating and modifying a JSON file, then you ought to be capable of completing this task.
 * It is likewise intended for individuals who possess a bit more experience yet seek to make their initial open source contribution, or to accumulate additional contributions for enhanced experience and confidence.

## Why bother creating this project?
I am an unknown individual; even you (who are currently reading this) are unaware that I exist, and I fear that I may vanish at any moment and be forgotten over time. Developing this project grants me a sense of assurance to establish a legacy, a legacy that bears my mark, so that in the future, I might assist at least one (1) person in contributing to the community. I also aim to foster not just my own confidence but the confidence of newcomers as well; I understand the feeling of intimidation when I first entered the Open Source Community and experienced its complexity and chaos. Even now, I feel daunted by the disorder of the community, but eventually, I learned the "chaos theory": the more you observe the chaos, the more you will identify a pattern; the more patterns you recognize, the less chaotic it becomes. However, each time I observe it, my tiny brain cells become more overwhelmed, leading me to decide to create a project, a small project, a small step towards a larger leap.

## What outcome to expect?

The JSON File you just contributed will be rendered like the picture above, together with your social media link and resource that you/other can visit. (you can search your Github username in the web to show your Contribution and share it and boast it to your friend.)

Your JSON File you contributed contains "display_float_text" value (if not, we use your GitHub username as default) that we will float and display it in the [main page](https://first-accord.js.org).
